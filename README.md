# num_diff
Basic numerical diffrentiation with c++. diffrentiation nothing but slope.
math function is rep by the blue curve. 'x' is point to evaluate
Equation is F’(x ) = lt.h->0((f(x+h)-f(x))/h)).

Reduce h  = should closely resemble exact value of slope = (delta-x/delta-y).
Polynomial Fn : y = A+Bx+Cx^2+Dx^3+EX^4+… (10 DEGREE POLY = 11 COEFFS), CAN HAVE 100 DEGREE POLY AS WELL.

For Polynomial function A,B,C,D,E, are CO-EFFS or CONSTANTS

# num_diff
Basic numerical diffrentiation with c++
math function is rep by the blue curve
F’(x ) = lt.h->0((f(x+h)-f(x))/h))
reduce h closely resemble exact value of slope = (delta-x/delta-y)
Polynomial Fn : y = A+Bx+Cx^2+....EX^4+… (10 DEGREE POLY = 11 COEFFS), CAN HAVE 100 DEGREE POLY AS WELL
for Polynomial Fn
A,B,C,D,E, – POLY CO-EFFS or CONSTants
